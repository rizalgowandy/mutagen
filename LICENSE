Unless otherwise specified, all code in this repository is made available under
the terms of the MIT License, the text of which can be found below.

Some code has been forked and/or vendored from projects released under different
non-copyleft licenses, all of which are indicated by comments at the top of the
relevant files.

All code that resides under the sspl directory is made available under the terms
of the Server Side Public License, the text of which can be found in
sspl/LICENSE.

From Mutagen v0.17 onward, SSPL-licensed code is included by default in official
Mutagen release builds. Users wishing to create a Mutagen build with only
MIT-licensed and non-copyleft-licensed code can do so by running the build
script and omitting the --sspl flag. The sidecar Dockerfile also still defines
both non-SSPL and SSPL targets, both of which are still currently shipped.
